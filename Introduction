The main project therefore aims to manage tasks, from their creations to the return to the client. 

It is a static class allowing the management of tasks and elements of conversations between the different protagonists 
for the resolution of these.
What we call "message" are exchanges between people:
 -> Internal for a person in the organization
 -> External for an affiliated person external to the organization (management of mail sending and interception of incoming mail behind)
 -> Comment in order to complete information and without being intended for someone specific

Here are the two key methods of the class:
- "FillConversationFromTask" method is the initial function, it will be called for the filling of user display preferences, 
  to retrieve any documents constituting a task, the characteristics of a task and finally the elements of conversations.
- "SaveAndSendNewMessage method" will retrieve the message type (internal, external message or comment)

In order to optimize processing times, calls to services are obviously asynchronous.

To allow more optimal maintainability, the code is made more readable and refactoring (with Resharper) is not systematically 
carried out because this sometimes makes the code more complicated to re-read when you come back in months later.
